# Drive-Check-A-Bus-Monitoring-Application-
 For my Final Year Project, I developed DriveCheck, an Android app using Kotlin and Firebase. It enhances passenger safety by monitoring driver drowsiness and overspeeding, with dashboards for real-time tracking and safety tools. Firebase ensures seamless data management and alerts.

 #Explanation
For my Final Year Project, I developed an innovative Android application called DriveCheck. We created this app to reduce accidents and enhance passenger safety.

Built using Kotlin and leveraging Firebase as the database backend, DriveCheck features two distinct dashboards tailored to the needs of owners and drivers. Owners can monitor real-time driver activities, such as detecting drowsiness and overspeeding, and receive instant notifications for any detected issues. Additionally, owners of travel agencies can view a list of all registered drivers and see which drivers are currently online. Clicking on any driver's name leads to a detailed activity page displaying real-time drowsiness status, real-time overspeeding detection, the driver's name, and their live location.

Drivers, on the other hand, have access to a drowsiness detection system and a speedometer to ensure their alertness and adherence to speed limits. The integration with Firebase enables seamless data management and synchronization, allowing owners to access comprehensive insights on online drivers and delve into detailed profiles to monitor drowsiness and speed violations effectively.

#Tools & Technologies:

In DriveCheck, I utilized Firebase as the database backend to enable robust data management and synchronization between the application and the cloud. Firebase allowed seamless real-time updates and ensured that both owners and drivers could access up-to-date information instantly. Owners could monitor driver activities in real-time, such as drowsiness detection and overspeeding alerts, thanks to Firebase's real-time database capabilities.

Additionally, I incorporated the Location Manager in Android to access the device's location services. This integration facilitated live location tracking of drivers, enabling owners to monitor their whereabouts accurately. The Location Manager ensured that the application could continuously update and display the current location of drivers on maps within the owner's dashboard.

Furthermore, DriveCheck utilized OpenStreetMap (OSM) for mapping and geolocation purposes. By leveraging OSM, the application could display detailed maps and accurately pinpoint driver locations and routes. This integration not only enhanced the visual representation of driver activities but also provided contextual information crucial for monitoring and ensuring safe driving practices.

Together, Firebase, Location Manager, and OSM integration in DriveCheck enabled comprehensive real-time monitoring, enhanced safety features, and efficient data management critical for the project's objectives of reducing accidents and enhancing passenger safety.
